Package `autodiffr` provides an `R` wrapper for `Julia` packages [`ForwardDiff.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl) and [`ReverseDiff.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ReverseDiff.jl) through [`JuliaCall`](https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall) to do **automatic differentiation** for native `R` functions
and some `Rcpp` functions.
