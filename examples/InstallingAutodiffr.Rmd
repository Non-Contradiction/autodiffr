## Introduction

`autodiffr` is an **R** package to exploit the Automatic Differentiation facilities
of the Julia computation system. Automatic Differentiation allows the computation of
derivatives of a function to the accuracy of analytic expressions. Moreover, it allows
the user to avoid the effort, difficulty and tedium of developing derivatives by hand.

## Prerequisites

Whatever system you use, to use `autodiffr` you need to install Julia,
and indeed a (possibly the) correct version of Julia.

Go to https://julialang.org/downloads and choose the correct download
for your system, and the correct version (at the time of writing 0.6.4)
and install as appropriate. Note that the version of Julia is important,
and the version available in the package repository of some systems may
be inappropriate. Particular instructions are given in the sections below
for different OS families.

We also need a sufficiently up-to-date version of **R**, though at the time
of writing, the most recent lacks some tools on some operating systems.
For example, there is not yet an appropriate version of the `Rtools` software
for Windows 7 to accompany R-3.5.1 at 2018-7-27. This collection of software
is largely provided in most *nix systems, including Mac OS. 


## Linux

Installation on Linux has some dependencies that may 
cause trouble. Some distros may not have the necessary 
versions of libraries, and cannot run `autodiffr`.
We will try to suggest what these may be, but since there
are many distros, with variations on their library infrastructure,
this list will be haphazard.
Moreover, as with the version of Julia, we may need correct
versions of some system libraries.

We have not tested if a 64 bit distribution is required. That
is, 32 bit distros have not been tried.

We have verified that the following distros support `autodiffr`

- Linux Mint 18.3 Sylvia
- Ubuntu 18.04 (HWB? Did you test)
- Debian Stretch (9.5)
- Linux Mint 19 Mate "Tara" (To get `devtools` to install, it was necessary to
install the Debian/Ubuntu "Bionic" packages libssl-dev and libcurl4-openssl-dev.
Installing R package `codetools` was done following a note when Rcpp was 
installed as a devtools dependency. Then JuliaCall and autodiffr were installed
with install_github().)


The following distros do not appear to work:

- Bunsenlabs Deuterium 64 bit. (libstdc++.so.6 does not have GLIBC in a sufficiently recent version). This is based on Debian Jessie, and it is likely that distros in that family will not support `autodiffr`.
- Elementary OS Freya 0.3.2 (same complaint about GLIBC)

### Virtualbox special needs - Debian or Ubuntu based distros

If you install in virtualbox, you will want to install the Guest Additions.
In a running Virtualbox guest OS
you need to choose Devices / Insert Guest Additions CD
This will likely auto-mount (if not, click on it in a file manager GUI).
To install the guest additions, you will likely need to install the 
  `build-essential`
package (Debian and Ubuntu family). You will also need the right linux-headers.
Use the command  `uname -a` to get the linux kernel verion, then install (again
Debian or Ubuntu)  `linux-headers-version`  where `version` is something like 
`4.10.0-38`. It may be necessary to reboot here so these headers are recognized.
Certainly a new terminal will be needed. 
Then either `sudo` the following commands or `su -` first.

```
  cd /media/cdrom
  sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
```

You can also set up a shared folder to allow for easy recording and transfer
of files between host and guest OS environments. 

In Debian/Ubuntu systems, to install an up-to-date R, first get the signature key 
for Johannes Ranke

```
apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 'E19F5F87128899B192B1A2C2AD5F960A256A04AF'
```

NOTE: you may need to install the `dirmngr` package first in some distros.

In debian or ubuntu, as root,

```
apt install r-base-dev r-recommended
```

will install R.

To install Julia, in a web browser, go to https://julialang.org and download
the 0.6.4 version tarball. 

Extract this in your home directory. Rename `julia-xxxxx`, where `xxxxx` is the
suffix to the name on your syste, to `j`.
Then as root

```
  ln -s /home/(you)/j/bin/julia /usr/bin/julia
```

You can test julia with the command `julia` in a terminal window.

### Getting `autodiffr` working

Start **R** in a terminal and run

```
install.packages("devtools")
```

On some systems, however, you may need to install some packages.
Do this in a separate terminal window. Note that the messages from 
`install.packages` suggest the names of packages to install for major distros.

`autodiffr` needs a fairly recent version of the package `JuliaCall` (??ref by Changcheng).
It can be installed by 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall")
```
Once this succeeds, `autodiffr` can  be installed by:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Non-Contradiction/autodiffr")
```

After the installation is finished, we can run the package.
Note that the first time `ad_setup()` is run during a session, 
it will take considerable time, but the next time it should be better.
?? Is this only slow the first execution overall, or does each 
session start take the same time??


```{r, eval=FALSE}
require(autodiffr)
ad_setup()
```

```
Error in juliacall_initialize(.julia$dll_file) : 
C:\Users\john\AppData\Local\JULIA-~1.4\bin\libjulia.dll 
- The specified procedure could not be found.
```

There is a msg box that gives the entry point that could not be found, with 
a reference to libstdc++-6.dll

```{r myscrshot, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, fig.cap="ErrBox", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("JuliaWin32ErrorBox.png")
```



## Macintosh

### On Macintosh (Hans W Borchers)

Any newer macOS operating system should be sufficient, at least
version 10.8; here we will use macOS "High Sierra" (that is 10.13.6).
We assume you have R version 3.4.1 or higher installed, but preferable
R >= 3.5.1 as the 3.5 series is significantly faster (on Mac), I saw
speed improvements of a factor of 2 and more in some of my
applications.

From the 'downloads' page of Julia,
<https://julialang.org/downloads/>, get the disk image file for Julia
version 0.6.4 (works also with 0.6.3) and install it on your Mac
computer in the usual way. You will find more platform-specific
instructions on <https://julialang.org/downloads/platform.html> but in
principle it is as easy as this.

If you did not install the Julia image in the `/Applications` folder,
you need to add the path to the Julia binary to your PATH variable or
-- what I found easier -- as superuser create a symbolic link in the
`/usr/local/bin` directory with

    sudo ln -s path/to/julia-0.6.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia
/usr/local/bin/julia

To see if Julia is installed correctly, open a Terminal window and
type in the Julia command `julia`. You will see the usual prelude and
the Julia prompt.

The *autodiffr* start-up procedure `ad_setup()` will install necessary
Julia packages. Because this can take quite a long time, pre-install
some of these packages directly from Julia, e.g. the important
`RCall.jl` package.

    $ julia
    julia> Pkg.add("RCall")

After some minutes about 30 or more packages are installed on your
computer. You can find them in your Home directory at
`~/.julia/v0.6/`. If you like, add also the forward and backward
automatic differentiation packages "ForwardDiff" and "ReverseDiff".
Some other depending packages will be installed, too.

Now it's time to install the R packages *JuliaCall* and *autodiffr*.
Both are available on CRAN, but it is better to get their newest
versions from Github, utilizing the *devtools* package.

    devtools::install_github("Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall")
    devtools::install_github("Non-Contradiction/autodiffr")

When loading the library *autodiffr* it is still necessary to create a
process running Julia, to connect to it, to check whether all needed
Julia packages are installed resp. to install them in case they are
missing. All this is done by the `ad_setup` function. If everything is
in place, it will finish in short time, otherwise it may take several
minutes (the first time it is called).

    library(autodiffr)
    ## Attaching package: ‘autodiffr’
    ## The following object is masked from ‘package:stats’:
    ##     deriv

    ad_setup()
    ## Julia version 0.6.4 at location [...]/julia/bin will be used.
    ## Loading setup script for JuliaCall...
    Finish loading setup script for JuliaCall.
    INFO: Precompiling module DiffResults.
    INFO: Precompiling module ForwardDiff.
    INFO: Precompiling module ReverseDiff.

The first time `ad_setup()` is called on your system, these three
Julia modules / packages are being precompiled, later on this will not
happen again, except when the julia packages get installed anew (e.g.,
a new version has appeared). Please note that `ad_setup` is required
whenever you load the *autodiffr* package into R.

Now automatic differentiation is ready to get applied. As a test,
define an R function and take its gradient (or Jacobian or Hessian).
For instance, the following function will have a quite well known
derivative.

    f <- function(x) exp(x)
    exp(1.0); grad(f, 1.0)
    ## [1] 2.718281828459045
    ## [1] 2.718281828459045

We see the result is accurate to the last digit. Compare this with a
numerical derivative, such as is provided through the *numDeriv*
package.

    numDeriv::grad(f, 1.0)
    ## [1] 2.718281828442632

Function names `grad`, `jacobian`, `hessian` are used in the
*numDeriv* (and *pracma*) package as well, so have to be qualified
when used in parallel with the *autodiffr* package.

IMPORTANT: Do *not* install the upcoming Julia 0.7 as there are
breaking changes between the 0.6 and 0.7/1.0 versions. After Julia 0.7
has become official and all relevant Julia packages have been updated
to the new version, *autodiffr* will be adapted and published on CRAN.



## Windows


On some Windows systems, antivirus protection may need to be disabled
so the install can be accomplished. For example, though the ultimate
installation of autodiffr failed, on a Windows 7 32bit Virtual Machine 
under VirtualBox, AVG antivirus (Free version) had to be disabled 
(protection turned off) to enable the Julia install, which was to 
`C:\Users\john\AppData\Local\Julia-0.6.4`. In the `bin\` subdirectory, there
is julia.exe and this can be run in a terminal, or double-clicked to open.
Julia runs, and can be terminated by `exit()` or `quit()`. Remember to 
re-enable antivirus protection once the installation of Julia (or other
necessary software) is complete. 


### Windows 10 

Asus UX303 -- worked. What were steps?

Install Julia.

Install R

Need Rtools.

Install `devtools` and use it to `install_github()`
`JuliaCall` and `autodiffr`.

Note that PATH needs editing. (Search in Control Panel for 
Environmental Variables to get the edit panel). Path for R
seems to be set automatically, but Julia path (to the "bin"
subdirectory) should be added. In my case this was
```
C:\Users\J\AppData\Local\Julia-0.6.4\bin
```


### Windows 7 - 64 bit

Asus EEE 1225B

Running in a fresh instance of julia gives the same "RCall not properly
installed" error from before.



## Testing the `autodiffr` installation

And we can use package `numDeriv` to compare with `autodiffr`.

```{r}
require(numDeriv)
```

## extra material

Note that later we will probably need to adjust some or other PATH variables, and
possibly set up links to ensure **R** can find Julia.

To get Julia to start in R, `C:\Users\john\AppData\Local\Julia-0.6.4\bin` needs
to be in the PATH. Then a CMD box will start Julia with the command `julia`.
However, after require(autodiffr), the ad_setup() call gives an error

```
Julia version 0.6.4 at location 
C:\Users\john\AppData\Local\JULIA-~1.4\bin will be used.
Error in juliacall_initialize(.julia$dll_file) : 
  C:\Users\john\AppData\Local\JULIA-~1.4\bin\libjulia.dll 
  - The specified procedure could not be found.
```

Thus for Windows, there must be another setting somewhere needed.

May be due to R 3.4.4??





then download Helium 64 and install, Guest Addiaions download
	and try to install, todos, Allowed upgrade, added java support. Backports
	from testing, leafpad, build-essential
          sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)  ## to get right headers
        "Insert" VBoxGuestAdditions, cd /media/cdrom
          sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
        Reboot. 
	Could not get larger. xrandr shows 1024 is largest screen. Also had difficulty
	getting R 3.5.1 -- some key problem.
        Set up Debian Stretch. installed build-essential, checked uname -a, then installed
        linux-headers for correct version. Then su - and install VBoxLinuxAdditions.run.
	Had to do 'xrandr --output VGA-1 --mode "1440x900" to get large display.
	Installed leafpad. Added ... /debian stretch-cran35/ to sources.list
        Note: needed to install dirmngr. But stretch-cran35 does not have a Release file. 
        Turned out it was "cdrom" that was problem. -- just comment it out in sources.list
        Downloaded julia 0.6.4 from julialang.org, unpacked in ~, renamed julia-xxxxx to j
	As root set symlink in /usr/bin to j/bin/julia. Tested it works.
	start R. install("devtools"), but needed git2r, httr (which needed system libssl-dev)
        and libcurl-openssl-dev. devtools in.
        require(devtools) /  install_github("Non-contradiction/JuliaCall")
        install_github("Non-contradiction/autodiffr")
        require(autodiffr) / ad_setup()  ## takes a very long time and disk is flashing
	## Is it trying to locate a library file??
        Eventually finished (20 mins?)
        Then test <- function(x) { sum(x*x) }
             testg <- makeGradFunc(test)
             x0 <- c(1,3,5)
             test(x0) ## 35
             testg(x0) ## 2  6  10

	Later re-installed mintupdate and virtualbox-guest-dkms, ...x11 and one other removed,
	then screen sized to max automatically.


?? need to check path

?? symlink


Julia.exe is in `C:\Users\john\AppData\Local\Julia-0.6.4` after installation
( 32 bit -- the extra steps were not necessary as far as I can tell)
`C:\Users\john\AppData\Local\Julia-0.6.4\bin` was added to the PATH.

CMD box then runs julia fine.
