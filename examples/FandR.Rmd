## Introduction

`autodiffr` is now a work-in-progress. You can install it by
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Non-Contradiction/autodiffr")
```

It's also recommended to install the latest version of `JuliaCall` by
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall")
```

And after the installation is finished, just do the following steps,
note that the first time it will take some time, but the next time it should be better.
```{r}
library(autodiffr)
ad_setup()
```
