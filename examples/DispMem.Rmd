## Introduction

We want to disply the current memory.

The purpose of this is so we can gauge the memory use of `autodiffr`. Because it
uses R and Julia, and likely some system resources, launching a function that
uses `autodiffr` resources will use memory, and functions within **R** are not
likely to capture this.

```{r}
dmem <- function(){ 
    system("free > ./tt.txt")
    writeLines(readLines("./tt.txt"))
    unlink("./tt.txt")
}
# put through file to force display in knitr

dmem()
```
