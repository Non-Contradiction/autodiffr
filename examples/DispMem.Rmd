```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

We want to disply the current memory.

```{r}
dmem <- function(){ 
    system("free > ./tt.txt")
    writeLines(readLines("./tt.txt"))
    unlink("./tt.txt")
}
# put through file to force display in knitr

dmem()
```
